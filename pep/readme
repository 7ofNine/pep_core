* PEP installation
The source code for PEP is contained in two zip files called pepf.zip
(with all of the subroutines) and pepi.zip (with all other files,
including this "readme" file).  Both zip files should be unzipped into
the same directory, which should be called "pep".  To install, change
to the pep directory and issue the commands "make new" and "make pep".
If any source files are later modified, the updated PEP can be created
by issuing just "make pep".

* PEP MINIBOOK - documentation of PEP input controls
The operation of PEP is controled by an input stream which is described
in detail in the comments at the beginning of the relevant subroutines.
The following is a list of the subroutines containing such comments,
along with a note about the subject matter covered in each subroutine
or group of subroutines.
