c        indicating no integration and input JD2 to override that on

c
c time direction of output tape is from JD1 to JD2, forward in
c        time if JD1 .lt. JD2, backward in time if JD1 .gt. JD2
c
c if JD0 .lt.0 & .gt.-3000000, output tape from a previous integration
c        is read to the time -JD0 (or to the record just before end
c        of file if JD0=-1 ) and the coordinates on the tape at
c        that epoch are used to restart that integration, proceeding
c        from -JD0 to JD2. Integration cannot go in both
c        directions from epoch -JD0 in restart mode and a
c        previous integration cannot be restarted at a time in the
c        first direction of the previous integration if it was in the
c        two direction mode, since output tape is not written until it
c        gets to second direction. In the checkpoint restart mode with
c        JD0 negative, the only data which can be input for the
c        integration are JD1,JD0,JD2,K(99),EPS(2),EPS(6) because rest
c        of the integration data is taken from the second record of the
c        tape of the previous integration.  If K(99) .lt.0, the tape
c        of the previous integration is rewound, whereas if
c        K(99) .ge.0, the restarted integration continues writing
c        the tape of the previous integration.
c
c if JD0 is positive between JD1 and JD2, we have
c       (a) if JD0=JD1, numerical integration starts at JD0
c           and proceeds to JD2, writing output tape as integration
c           proceeds if K(99).ge.0
c       (b) if JD0 is strictly between JD1 and JD2, integration
c           starts at JD0 and goes in direction of JD1 (forward
c           in time if JD0 .lt. JD1, backward in time if JD0 .gt.
c           JD1). The integration polynomial coefficients determined
c           at JD0 by the starting proceedure are saved and the
c           numerical integration proceeds towards JD1, writing onto
c           disk buffer IBUF if K(99).ge.0.  When JD1 is reached,
c           IBUF is backspaced and read to write output tape ITAPE in
c           time direction from JD1 to JD0 if K(99).ge.0.  Then
c           using the saved starting polynomial coefficients, the
c           integration goes from JD0 to JD2, writing output
c           tape ITAPE as the integration proceeds if K(99).ge.0.
c           When the integration is completed, we have an output tape
c           from JD1 to JD2, even though integration went from
c           JD0 to JD1 and then from JD0 to JD2. These
c           contortions are gone through in order to simplify the logic
c           needed to read the tape in the COMPAR link.
c
c           Note: in a simultaneous integration of lunar orbit,
c           libration, and core rotation, three separate buffers are
c           needed for the two-direction mode.  IBUF is used for the
c           orbit, while KK(13) and KK(12) of the Moon rotation are
c           used for the libration and core rotation, respectively.
c
c
c INT  gives interval between tabular points.
c if  INT.gt.0, tabular interval is  INT days (only value allowed
c               if NPLNT=1,...,9,11,...,30 and NCENTR=0)
c if  INT.le.0, tabular interval is 2**INT days (for the Moon, NPLNT=10,
c               it is expected that INT=-1 for half day tabular intervl)
c These constant output tabular intervals apply throughout the
c integration for integration methods K(88)=1,2,3. for K(88)=0 method,
c output interval from initial epoch to first tabular point is
c controlled by INT. Thereafter, tabular output is every step of
c variable step Nordsieck integration. Output every step immediately
c after the initial epoch is supressed because the starting interval for
c the Nordsieck method of integration is very small, but it grows to the
c size warranted by the stability requirements of the differential
c equations integrated and the input accuracy constant EPS(3) as the
c integration proceeds away from the initial epoch.
c
c
c ITAPE =   data set number for output tape
c           first record is 88 characters describing computer run,second
c           record is data about body integration, including
c           IPAR=number of partials+1 (calculated in setup for integ.)
c           third and subsequent records have integration results.

c           IVL=6 in integration output routine so velocity will be on
c           tape for checkpoint restart purposes. To save space on tape
c           or disk output can be copied with IVL=3 before recent times
c           since optical observations do not need accurate velocity
c           and the velocity they need is gotten by numerical
c           differentiation from position tabulation.
c           Everett eighth difference interpolation is used to
c           interpolate from this tape in the COMPAR link. There are
c           three records in storage in the COMPAR link and there are
c           five tabular points per record so that can interpolate for
c           any time in the middle record (need more than four tabular
c           points per record because of the existence of receive,
c           reflection and send times of an observation)
c
c           (2) if NPLNT=10 for the Moon there are eight tabular points

c           for the given tabular point at time JD,FRACT
c           IORD  = order of time derivative - 1 for motion on tape
c           JORD  = order of time derivative - 1 for partial on tape
c           NUMPRT= number of partials on tape

c                   next tabular point
c           There are six records in storage in compar link for Hermite
c           interpolation for a time point in the midst of the middle
c           four tabular points so that either a two or four point
c           Hermite interpolation method can be used of order limited
c           only by the number of derivatives on the tape and by our
c           being able to derive the formulas. The derivatives after
c           acceleration come from the Nordsieck intgration coefficients
c           which are not the real higher derivatives in so far as
c           they tend to lag behind the current tabular point, the jerk
c           lagging least of all.

c    (a) Normally, COND(1-6) are the
c        initial osculating eliptic orbital elements with non-time
c        variable gravitational constant and with augmented mass of
c        central body (so that equations for partial of motion with

c    (c) Input controls may specify other types of initial conditions.
c The equations of motion are integrated in a coordinate system
c referred to the mean equinox and equator of the reference epoch.
c (See JCT(13).)
c
c The above conventions for initial conditions are superceded by the
c following (default value of icnd is given by above)
c ICND =-1 initial conditions are cartesian position and velocity
c          (units are astronomical units and astronomical units per day)
c          (referred to mean equinox and equator of reference epoch)
c ICND = 0 initial conditions are elliptic orbital elements
c ICND = 1 initial conditions are elliptic orbital elements with sums of
c          angles   ASC, ASC+PER, ASC+PER+ANOM
c ICND = 2 initial conditions are
c          COND(1) = distance from central body (astronomical units)
c          COND(2) = right ascension of position (epoch coordinates)
c                    (between 0 and 360 deg)

c The initial conditions must be in one of the above forms in the input
c stream, but several variants are allowed, namely, distance and vel-
c ocity may be in other units, the reference frame may be other than
c 1950 mean equatorial, and the velocity 'v' of adbarv notation may be
c the total velocity.  The variants, if any, are all resolved to the
c standard forms in the input procedure.  For convenience, the elements
c may be input in one form (say, Cartesian) and converted to another
c (say, elliptic).  The desired final form is always specified via
c 'ICND' (as above), and the input form, if different, via 'INCND' with
c (with the same logic as 'ICND' above).
c
c INCND=-1 input elements are Cartesian
c INCND= 0 input elements are elliptic
c INCND= 1 input elements are elliptic with angle sums

c INUNIT=-1 input distances, velocities are au, au/40 d
c INUNIT= 0 input distances, velocities are au, au/d

c INUNIT= 2 input distances, velocities are ft, ft/s
c
c LCND=0 normal ADBARV notation
c LCND=1 input ADBARV (if any) has v=total velocity, not excess
c
c JTYPE specifies the reference frame of input elements.  The default
c is -1 (1950 mean equinox and equator).  See below for other options.
c
c For Moon rotation there is special logic that applies only to the
c core's angle rates:
c INCND=0 input rates are Euler angle rates
c INCND=3 input rates are angular velocity components of the core in
c         the frame of the mantle (to be converted to "0" if ICND=0)
c         If ICND=3, then retain these values and integrate only the
c         core angular velocity, ignoring what would otherwise be the
c         Euler angles

c There are 4 planet shape models programmed in the radar link of PEP.
c CON(2,3 or 4) for NPLNT.gt.0 turns on shape for radar observations of
c a planet.  The model is given as harmonic input for body -NPLNT in
c one of the following manners:
c        1)shperical harmonic expansion, if nshp=0 (default)
c        2)fourier series model, if nshp=1
c        3)altitude grid (local model), if nshp=2
c        4)external model if nshp=3
c
c In the spherical harmonic expansion over the whole planet surface,
c CON(2-4) for NPLNT are J1,C11,S11 with Jn,Cmj,Smj (n.le.NZONE, m.le.
c NTESS, j.le.m) for -NPLNT being the remaining harmonic coefficients.
c normalized coefficients are used for shape, whereas unnormalized are
c used for the gravitational potential. for the spherical harmonic model
c planet radius = CON(1) + spherical harmonic series
c (units are seconds in solution for harmonic coef,  km for CON(1)  )
c
c ***** Fourier series model
c
c If NSHP=1 for -NPLNT the Fourier series model is used with
c TLAT(1) and TLAT(2) equal to the lower and upper latitude
c values for the planet NPLNT being analyzed.
c Let phi=east long on planet,
c     theta=(latitude-tlat(1))/(tlat(2)-tlat(1))*twopi
c planet radius = function of CON(1) mean radius and CON(2) degree of
c flattening + fourier series coefficients for -NPLNT
c the shape model, as it is currently, is a 2-dimensional fourier series
c with 20 longitudinal terms (smallest period = 360/20=18 deg) and
c 1 latitudinal term.  it is:  h(theta,phi)= summation for m=1,20 of
c        (am*cos(m*phi)*cos(theta)  +  bm*cos(m*phi)*sin(theta)
c      +  cm*sin(m*phi)*cos(theta)  +  dm*sin(m*phi)*sin(theta)
c      +  a'm*cos(m*phi)  +  c'm*sin(m*phi) )
c      +  a''*cos(theta)  +  b''*sin(theta)
c notice that the a' and c' coefficients are just longitude dependent,
c and the a'' and b'' are the only two latitude-only terms.
c all 122 fourier series and radius & flattening partial derivatives
c should be calculated when computing the observed minus theoretical
c values of observations.  suggested parameters to be solved for
c in addition to radius and perhaps flattening are:
c Mercury - only low order longitudinal terms, maybe a'1 thru a'5 and
c           c'1 thru c'5.
c Venus   - how about a'1 thru 20 and c'1 thru 20?
c Mars    - probably all 122 fourier shape parameters
c
c Summary: to use the fourier shape section of coding you set NSHP=1,
c TLAT(1&2) equal to lower and upper latitude values for the rectangle
c (almost) on the planet being analyzed in &NMLST2 for -NPLNT.
c Default values presently set are:
c     Mercury   TLAT(1)=-15., TLAT(2)=15.,
c     Venus     TLAT(1)=-15., TLAT(2)=15.,
c     Mars      TLAT(1)=-30., TLAT(2)=30.,
c In the corresponding &NMLST2 with positive NPLNT, CON(2)=1.0E-20_10
c sets npshp=1 so HARSHP is called, and L(7)=1, as usual, adjusts the
c radius. In addition L(8)=2 adjust flattening CON(2), which could
c have a real value instead of the dummy 1.E-20_10 used as a switch.
c Units of radius are km, flattening is dimensionless, and
c units of Fourier seriers coefficients for radius are light-seconds.
c
c      The Fourier series coefficients and L-vectors may be input
c directly as the following &NMLST2 variables:
c    coefficients                                       l-vectors
c   fa(1)  to fa(20)         for a coefficients            lfa
c   fb(1)  to fb(20)         for b coefficients            lfb
c   fc(1)  to fc(20)         for c coefficients            lfc
c   fd(1)  to fd(20)         for d coefficients            lfd
c   fap(1) to fap(20)        for a' coefficients           lfap
c   fcp(1) to fcp(20)        for c' coefficients           lfcp
c   fapp                     for a'' coefficient           lfapp
c   fbpp                     for b'' coefficient           lfbpp
c      to adjust coefficients, set appropriate l-vector to 1
c ***** example *****
c   mercury fourier series shape
c   solve for a'1 thru a'5 and c'1 thru c'5
c      required input is:
c       &nmlst2
c       NPLNT= -1,name= 'shpmrcry',
c       nshp= 1,
c       lfap= 1,1,1,1,1,     (or lfap= 5*1,)
c       lfcp= 1,1,1,1,1,     (or lfcp= 5*1,)
c       &end
c
c ***** altitude grid-local shape model (s.brody 5/76)
c
c if nshp=2 for -NPLNT the shape model is a grid of
c altitudes (in kilometers) relative to an adjusted spheroid
c for a appropriate region of the planet NPLNT. the region
c of applicability for the model is input as the real*4
c nmlst2 variables tlat(1),tlat(2),tlon(1),tlon(2) representing
c minimum and maximum values for latitude and longitude, respectively
c (in degrees). tlatin and tlonin give the increment in
c degrees for lat and long (ie the grid spacing). default
c values for the lat. range are as given above for the fourier
c series model. default for long is 0 to 360 degrees (east)
c grid spacing defaults are 10 degrees. (latdim,londim) the dimensions
c of the grid and the total number of grid points (ngdpts) are computed
c from tlat,tlon,tlatin,tlonin.
c to input a priori estimates for grid points (in km),
c determine the corresponding index into the (1-dimensional)'grid'
c array where the 2-dimensional grid points are stored by
c row (ie., in latitude strips). grid(1) corresponds to the
c grid point of min. long and max lat (ie., the upper left
c point). lgrid is the l-vector for the grid points with
c     lgrid(i)=0, do not adjust grid(i)
c             =1,        adjust grid(i)
c as in the fourier shape model, the flattening coefficient CON(2)
c for the body |NPLNT| should be set to some small non-zero value,
c such as 1E-20_10 to enable the shape computations in the COMPAR link.
c note that the flattening may also be treated as an adjustable
c parameter as well as a switch.
