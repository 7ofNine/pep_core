PEP VARIABLE LISTING
    This compilation of variables found in PEP was originally
generated by Bob King in 1971. At that time it was incomplete. In the
spring of 1975, Bob Goldstein took up the task of adding variables to
this list.  It will probably never be complete, but the attempt will be
made to describe all variables that are in common blocks as well as any
local variables that are important enough to warrant inclusion here.
We hope that all who use this listing will feel free to correct it and
add to it.  Please transmit all corrections and additions to John
Chandler in room 24-404, MIT, extension 3-6977.

Feb., 1976:   About 150 variables were added that occur in subroutine
    SBDLDP. Many of these apply to other subroutines in the COMPAR link.
    Also added were additions contributed by Steve Brody and Bob King.
    Note: SBDLDP is now replaced by the RADxx routines.

1980 Nov:  Further additions and corrections.
